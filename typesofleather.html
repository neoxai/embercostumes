<h3>Types of Leather</h3>
<strong>Veg-tan</strong> (Vegetable Tanned) is the most versatile and useful leather. Its the only leather that can be tooled and dyed easily. Most of our leather tutorials will be referring to Veg-tan leather unless otherwise noted.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Suede</strong> is leftover when veg-tan is split to make it more even. It doesn't have the tooling grain like the top of veg-tan, so both sides are "flesh". It cannot be tooled, and almost always comes pre-dyed. It tends to be thin and very flexible.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Chrome-tan</strong> is the expensive version of suede. It's what leather jackets are made of. I haven't had the desire to use it yet.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Upholstery</strong> leather is another expensive version of suede. If you can get it from an old couch, awesome. Otherwise ignore it.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Vinyl</strong> is <i>not leather</i>. It is often referred to as fake/faux-leather and such. It may look like leather from far away, and is a 
fraction of the cost, but it behaves more like plastic than leather. Great substitute for large or non-detailed items, but as a it doesn't breathe. It can be way hot and uncomfortable, and not good for outdoors in summer. On a budget, vinyl rocks. Temporary, short term costumes, vinyl is great. If you are going for smaller, higher quality pieces, veg-tan is what you need.

<h3>Thickness</h3>
Leather is measured in ounces. Since one piece is not a uniform thickness throughout, it will be listed as two numbers describing the range of thicknesses it can encompass. One "ounce" equals 1/64 of an inch.<br>
<br>
2/3 oz: Accessories, linings, laces, soft compressible pieces.<br>
4/5 oz: Pouches, small straps, embellishments. <br>
6/7 oz: *Most Used* Belts, costume armor, straps and fittings.<br>
8/9 oz: Combat armor, thick belts, reinforcements, cuir bouilli.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<!-- <h3>Cuts</h3>
This is the part of the cow the leather came from.


Shoulders: 
Belly: this is the most elastic part of a cow, and likewise the most prone to stretching pieces of leather. Not recommended for belts. -->


<h3>Animals</h3>
Most leather you will get from cows. For the most part, don't worry about anything else. Here's the quick run down of other animals leather can come from.<br>
<br>
<Strong>Deer</strong> have very thin, relatively tough skin. Worth experimenting with, it will drape more like fabric than cowhide.<br>
<strong>Pigskin</strong> is one of the toughest leathers easily available. It makes a great liner for bags or sheaths, or as a durable piece all by itself.<br>
<strong>Rabbit</strong> fur is very soft, warm and fragile. It can be used to line winter armor or even sewn to garments to increase their warmth.<br>
<strong>Exotic</strong> skins such as snake, ray, or shark have one thing in common: expense. If used sparingly, they can add very interesting patterns and textures to inlays, sword hilts, and accessories. <br>
